# visualization_samples

### This is a sample of the work I completed for CS 234 "Data Analysis and Visualizations" completed in the Fall of 2021. See Read me for more information!

### "time_series.ipynb" This notebook scrapes Wikipedia edits over time for 4 artists, and uses plotly to visualize the edits that have been made over time.

### "directors_barchart.ipynb" This notebook scrapes Wikipedia for list of American actresses, then it tests the hypothesis: 'Do actresses born in the 1950s have longer pages compared to actresses born in the 1980s?' Includes multiple examples of data visualizations utilizing histograms, boxplots and tables.

### "directors_barchart.ipynb" This notebook scrapes a website to access the list of best woman directors. Then utilizes multiple forms of data visualizations.

### "courses_stackedbarcharts.ipynb" This notebook uses data collected about the Wellesley College 2019 Course Catalogue. It uses dataframes and pandas for visualizations.

### "courses_boxplots.ipynb" This notebook uses data collected about the Wellesley College 2019 Course Catalogue. It uses seaborn for visualizations.
